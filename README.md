# Corontine CMS
This is a simple example addon written in NodeJS and Angular.

# Installation
Download the repository
run yarn install or npm install
yarn start:debug to initialize the server API 
cd components && yarn dev to start the angular custom elements watcher

# Installing the plugin on Corontine CMS
Log on CMS interface
Open System -> Addons Manager
Input the URL:
http://localhost:5000/api/v1/addon/new/addon 
and click on add.
After that, you will notice that you have another menu entry (Addons), so your plugin can be accessed from there.
